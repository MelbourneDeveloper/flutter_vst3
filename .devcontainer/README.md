# VST Development Container

This dev container provides a complete development environment for the VST project with all dependencies pre-installed.

## What's Included

- **Ubuntu 22.04** base image
- **CMake 3.22+** for building C++ components
- **Dart SDK** for Dart development
- **Flutter SDK** for Flutter UI development
- **VST3 SDK 3.7.11** pre-downloaded and configured
- **Build tools** (GCC, Make, etc.)
- **Audio development libraries** (ALSA, X11, etc.)

## Usage

### With VS Code

1. Install the **Dev Containers** extension in VS Code
2. Open this project folder in VS Code
3. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted (or use Command Palette: "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container")
4. Wait for the container to build (first time takes ~5-10 minutes)
5. Once ready, you can use the terminal to run:
   ```bash
   make build    # Build everything
   make test     # Run tests
   make help     # See all available commands
   ```

### Environment Variables

The container automatically sets:
- `VST3_SDK_DIR=/opt/vst3sdk` - Points to the pre-installed Steinberg VST3 SDK
- `PATH` includes Dart and Flutter binaries

### Verification

After the container starts, run:
```bash
make check-env
```

This should show all dependencies as available.
